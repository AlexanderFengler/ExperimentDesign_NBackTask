# ExperimentDesign_NBackTask
N Back working memory task, coded with the help of the Matlab Psychtoolbox. A number of difficulty levels included.

# What does the taks do?

There are two main functions *n_back_task_full()* and *n_back_task_training()*. In both functions the subject sees a series of colored rectangles and has to decide (by a press of the *space button*) whether the current rectangle matches the one that was shown *N* steps before. Number of difficulty levels, and number of color sequences within difficulty level can be specified and a break can be taken after each series. 

Several difficulty levels are included (from 2 to 5 steps back) and 8 color series are included per difficulty level. Each color series includes a sequence of 36 + n rectangles. The color series are generated such that within each series there a *12 matches* and *12 lures* (lures are rectangles which have matching colors to a rectangle before, but with a wrong offset in steps).

The task has been utilized as a collateral to a decision making experiment and shows a robust deterioration of performance across difficulty levels (dprime analysis within subject).

# To do List

- [ ] make background white
- [ ] add some explanation to task
- [ ] automate generation of sequences (specification of difficulty level, number of items and number of sequences within difficulty level)
- [ ] allow for read-in of arbitrary pictures instead of colored rectangles generated by psychtoolbox
